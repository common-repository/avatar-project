== Description ==
Receiving a comment on your blog post is great and the more comments the better the feeling. It means that not only your post is good but your site becomes more and more popular and thrust-worthy. When comments start rolling in, you must make sure they display properly and look good. It’s great when a comment author has taken the time to upload a custom image of herself on her Gravatar account, but as we all know only a handful of people actually do that. This means that your precious comment area ends up filled with no-face, gray avatar thumbnails that look plane boring.

Well, that ends here and now!

Take control of the way your comment area looks by installing Avatar Project. Avatar Project is a plugin that will replace all avatar icons that don’t have a custom avatar assigned to it. Depending on your websites look, feel and theme, choose one of our Avatar Project icon packs. Currently you have a choice between colorful blobers, cups hoped up on caffeine, smug cat faces and a bunch of actual human portraits.
This plugin will be useful for not only real, functioning blogs but for theme developers and designers as well. Install Avatar Project, write a couple of sample comments and make your comment area demonstration look much nicer than it would with the default avatars.
